# Nigeria-Traffic-Accident-2021---2023
The goal of this project was to develop an interactive dashboard that offers valuable insights into traffic accident trends across Nigeria from 2021 to 2023. The dashboard tracks key metrics and visualizes data to aid understanding and support decision-making efforts aimed at reducing road accidents.

Key Features:
•	Crashes by Quarter:
This visualization highlights the number of crashes recorded each quarter over the three-year period. By monitoring trends over time, it becomes easier to identify patterns that could inform targeted interventions to reduce accident rates.
•	Total Crashes by State:
Understanding which regions experience the highest number of accidents is essential for crafting effective policies. The dashboard includes a map chart that geographically visualizes crash data across all Nigerian states, helping stakeholders focus resources where they are most needed.
•	Contributing Factors to Accidents:
A donut chart is used to display the primary causes of traffic accidents nationwide. Speed violations and driver fatigue emerge as the leading contributors, accounting for 33.19% and 27.8% of crashes, respectively. This data provides lawmakers and traffic authorities with insight into where policy enforcement or public awareness campaigns may have the most impact—particularly concerning overspeeding on highways and commercial routes.
•	Fatalities and Injuries Over Time:
A line chart illustrates the quarterly progression of both fatalities and injuries resulting from road accidents. This view helps visualize the human cost of these incidents and emphasizes the urgency of implementing preventive measures.

Summary Metrics:
The dashboard also includes user-friendly KPI cards that highlight overall statistics from 2021 to 2023:
•	Total Crashes: Displays the cumulative number of crashes recorded during the period.
•	Total Fatalities: Shows the total number of deaths resulting from these accidents.
•	Total Casualties: Reflects the number of individuals injured across all reported incidents.
•	Total Vehicles Involved: Indicates the number of vehicles involved in accidents throughout the timeframe.
•	Top Crash State: Identifies the state with the highest number of recorded crashes.
